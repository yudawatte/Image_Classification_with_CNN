# Image_Classification_with_CNN
This repository contains cats and dogs image classification try outs using Convolution Neural Network with VGG blocks

1. cats_and_dogs_with_1_vgg_block
First I tried to understand how to build a CNN for image classification with the use of VGG blocks and how to use an image data generator.

2. cats_and_dogs_with_2_vgg_block
Extend the previous model with 2 VGG blocks.

3. cats_and_dogs_with_3_vgg_blocks_v1
Extend the previous model with 3 VGG blocks.

4. cats_and_dogs_with_3_vgg_blocks_v2
Enhanced 3 VGG block models with the use of regularization with Dropout layers.

5. cats_and_dogs_with_3_vgg_blocks_v3
Enhanced 3 VGG block models with the use of regularization with Dropout layers plus data augmentation with the train image set.

6. cats_and_dogs_with_keras_application_vgg16
Used Keras applicatin VGG_16 pretrained model
